# Enhancing Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) Performance through Electronic Affinity in Panchaloha Alloys

This project explores how the electronic affinity of materials can enhance the performance of Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) in protecting superalloys used in extreme temperature environments such as jet engines, power plants, and other industrial applications. The research focuses on modeling the effects of electronic affinity in various TBC materials like pure Zirconia (ZrO₂) with Yttria Stabilization (YSZ), YSZ composites, and MoO₃ and Al₂O₃-based coatings using COMSOL Multiphysics.

### Project Objective:
To analyze how adjusting the electronic properties of Thermal Barrier Coatings can improve heat resistance and oxidation protection for superalloys, ultimately enhancing the longevity and efficiency of components used in industries like aerospace, automotive, and power generation.

## Key Features:
- **Analysis of Superalloy Coatings**: Modeling various thermal barrier coatings (ZrO₂ with YSZ, YSZ composites, MoO₃, and Al₂O₃-based coatings).
- **Heat Resistance Simulation**: Simulating high temperatures to test the heat dissipation and protection offered by each coating.
- **Electron Affinity Adjustments**: Evaluating the effects of optimized electronic affinity values on heat shielding and material stability.

## Results:
- **Best Heat Resistance**: Pure ZrO₂ with YSZ provided the highest heat protection.
- **Lower Temperature Transfer**: 7-8% YSZ composite significantly reduced heat transfer to the underlying metal.
- **Enhanced Electron Affinity**: Adjusting the electronic affinity of coatings enhanced their heat resistance and overall performance.

## Applications:
- **Aerospace**: Improved longevity and reliability of jet engine components, reducing maintenance costs.
- **Automotive**: Enhanced heat-resistant materials for better fuel efficiency and performance.
- **Power Plants**: Increased efficiency and reduced repair needs for turbines.

## Research Approach:
1. **COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling**: Used to simulate various coatings and their interactions with heat.
2. **3D Model of Superalloy**: Built to simulate real-world conditions, such as those found in jet engines.
3. **Electron Affinity Impact**: Adjusted to analyze how changes in electron affinity improve heat protection.

## Future Work:
- **Real-World Testing**: Conduct testing on jet engines and turbines to validate simulation results.
- **Exploration of New Coatings**: Investigate additional materials for TBCs to withstand extreme environments.
- **Commercialization**: Develop new materials and products based on these findings for industrial applications.
